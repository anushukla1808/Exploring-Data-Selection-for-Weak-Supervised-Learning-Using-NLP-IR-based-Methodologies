# Exploring-Data-Selection-for-Weak-Supervised-Learning-Using-NLP-IR-based-Methodologies
This project focuses on selecting data for weak supervised learning, addressing noisy data in deep learning. QPP, an NLP/IR technique, estimates neighborhood quality for data instances. Useful for noisy data and labels, it enhances classifier training by treating data like queries and neighbors like documents, improving results.
